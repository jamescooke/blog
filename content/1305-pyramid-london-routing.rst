:summary: Talk at the first Pyramid London meetup about the Pyramid Router, URL Traversal and Dispatch.

Our first `Pyramid London meetup <http://www.meetup.com/The-London-Pyramid-Group/events/114457692/>`_ was kindly hosted at `Skills Matter <http://skillsmatter.com>`_, who have `posted the video of my talk on their page for the meetup <http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/routing-traversal-and-url-dispatch>`_.

All the code I demonstrated is on `GitHub in the pyramid-london-talk repository <https://github.com/jamescooke/pyramid-london-talk>`_ - Please note that the traversal code is in the traversal branch, not in a separate project.

I learned loads from preparing the demonstration code and chatting to everyone that attended - so thanks and hope to see you at the next meetup in June!
