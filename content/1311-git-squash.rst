It started with a Tweet
-----------------------

Over the weekend I spotted a tweet from `Oliver <https://oli.me.uk/>`_...

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>To squash features into develop, or not to squash features into develop?</p>&mdash; Oliver Caldwell (@OliverCaldwell) <a href="https://twitter.com/OliverCaldwell/statuses/401299558887485440">November 15, 2013</a></blockquote>
    <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And I jumped straight in with...

    `@OliverCaldwell <https://twitter.com/OliverCaldwell>`_ Squash, but keep
    detailed commit messages. Unless you have a particular use-case / reason
    not to.

    November 17, 2013

Then, as part of our following conversation, I drew a picture:

    :alt: Git squashing, feature versus history

..

    This is how I see it. Better to keep the direct route rather than the "how we got here".

    November 18, 2013

But...


It's about more than just squashing
-----------------------------------

What I realised while writing this post and experimenting with `git` is that
the issue is not as simple as "Squash? Yes / No?"

Variables to consider include:

* **How you record your commit messages on your squashed commit.** This effects
  the impact of history loss - good commit messages and or external ticketing /
  dev tracking mean it's less important.
* **Whether you push your feature branches for other developers, or between your
  dev boxes, to share.** Do you need to keep the shared history between machines?
* **The velocity of your project.** How long do you need to keep history for?
  Do bugs show up regularly?


TL;DR Simple project. Squash = Yes
----------------------------------

For a simple project with no sharing between devs required and regular
releases, then squashing features seems like a good idea if you:

* Keep detailed commit messages when you squash.
* Use `git rebase` to squash your features' commits into a candidate branch and
  merge that in to `dev` or `master` depending on your SCM strategy.
* Only push your squashed features to keep `origin` clean and easy to
  understand.
* Keep your feature branches if you want. But, if you delete them `git` will
  keep your commits in the reflog for 30 days by default.


Keeping a detailed history
--------------------------

One of the issues that Oliver raised was about losing history.

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jamesfublo">@jamesfublo</a> I suppose so. Squashing just feels like you&#39;re killing off that fine grained history, like when was that two line change made.</p>&mdash; Oliver Caldwell (@OliverCaldwell) <a href="https://twitter.com/OliverCaldwell/statuses/402394094111977472">November 18, 2013</a></blockquote>
    <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So, since I advocate squashing and branch deletion, I'm therefore suggesting
that the **reflog is used to recover detailed history in the local repository**
if required.

So let's explore how much history is actually kept...

`From the docs <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog>`_:

    Reflog is a mechanism to record when the tip of branches are updated.

This means that...

**Every commit that every branch in your local repostitory has ever pointed to
is kept in the reflog.**

And this even includes branch switching...

    HEAD reflog records branch switching as well.

Sounds very warm and cozy, **BUT** there are conditions, so let's do a
practical experiment with a test repository.


Experiment: Squashing with rebase and keeping history
-----------------------------------------------------

Make a repository with an initial commit.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git init

Create a `README.md` file and put a line of text into it and commit - this
commit is called A.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat > README.md
    First line of readme file
    ^C
    $ git add README.md
    $ git commit

Current `git` tree status::

    A   <-master

Work on feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a new branch, we create a *feature* to update the README with two new lines
and to delete the first line.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout -b feature-a

    # First feature commit (B)
    $ cat >> README.md
    Add a second line
    ^C
    $ git add README.md
    $ git commit

    # Second feature commit (C)
    $ cat >> README.md
    Add a third line
    ^C
    $ git add README.md
    $ git commit

    # Third feature commit (D)
    $ vim README.md
    # Remove first line and save
    $ git add README.md
    $ git commit


Current `git` tree status::

    A   <-master
     \
      B--C--D   <-feature-a

Check progress in reflog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checkout `master`.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout master

Let's check the reflog.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git reflog

::

    8e48d1d HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from feature-a to master
    262057a HEAD@{1}: commit: D: Remove first line
    9efbf73 HEAD@{2}: commit: C: Add a third line
    f2503d5 HEAD@{3}: commit: B: Add a second line
    8e48d1d HEAD@{4}: checkout: moving from master to feature-a
    8e48d1d HEAD@{5}: commit (initial): Make readme

Newest stuff pops out first:

* `HEAD@{0}` - Checkout from `feature-a` to `master` is recorded.
* `HEAD@{1}` to `HEAD@{3}` - our `feature-a` commits (D, C and B).
* `HEAD@{4}` - Checkout of the `feature-a` branch.
* `HEAD@{5}` - Initial commit.

Squash commits into candidate branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`feature-a` is ready to bring into `master`. Let's first cleanup our history by
doing an interactive rebase. We use a candidate branch for this work because
it's a nice safety net which can help with testing.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout feature-a
    $ git checkout -b feature-a-candidate

Current `git` tree status::

    A   <-master
     \
      B--C--D   <-feature-a <-feature-a-candidate

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git rebase --interactive master

Let's squash our three commits into one. ::

    pick f2503d5 B: Add a second line
    squash 9efbf73 C: Add a third line
    squash 262057a D: Remove first line

And now we merge together the three commits, describing the activity that took
place. We keep the messages so that history is clean, but informative. We also
include a reference to the ticket we are working against::

    Updating README.md as per #ticket

    * Add a second line
    * Add a third line
    * Remove first line

Check reflog again:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git reflog

::

    d0445b2 HEAD@{0}: rebase -i (finish): returning to refs/heads/feature-a-candidat
    d0445b2 HEAD@{1}: rebase -i (squash): Updating README.md as per #ticket
    362b6ef HEAD@{2}: rebase -i (squash): # This is a combination of 2 commits.
    f2503d5 HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from feature-a-candidate to f2503d5
    262057a HEAD@{4}: checkout: moving from feature-a to feature-a-candidate

The reflog shows us that there is a new commit `d0445b2`, we'll call this `E`.
This is the commit that results from the rebase and leaves the tree looking
like::

    A   <-master
    |\
    | B--C--D   <-feature-a
    \
     \
      E   <-feature-a-candidate

This is a good stage to test everything **and** to check that your tests are
what you expect them to be, ensure that no information has been lost.

Merge onto master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new commit `E` is the patch for our *feature* which we now merge onto
`master`.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge feature-a-candidate master

::

    Updating 8e48d1d..d0445b2
    Fast-forward
     README.md | 3 ++-
     1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

The tree::

    A--E   <-master <-feature-a-candidate
     \
      B--C--D   <-feature-a

Push
~~~~

At this stage the *feature* would usually be pushed to a branch on `origin`.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git push origin master

Note that we've only shared the squashed `E` commit, not `B`, `C` or `D` in the
`feature-a` branch.

Cleanup
~~~~~~~

We can then cleanup our working branches. First the candidate.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git branch -d feature-a-candidate

This leaves us with a tree like::

    A--E   <-master
     \
      B--C--D   <-feature-a


Keeping history
---------------

As Oliver noted, the `feature-a` branch can just be kept by the developer in
their local repository to preserve the full history - that is certainly an
option.

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jamesfublo">@jamesfublo</a> I suppose you can still keep the unsquashed branches in the repository. I never used to squash, but I might start.</p>&mdash; Oliver Caldwell (@OliverCaldwell) <a href="https://twitter.com/OliverCaldwell/statuses/402401798738018304">November 18, 2013</a></blockquote>
    <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However, I prefer a clean working repository so I like to delete the
`feature-a` branch.

Clean up the feature branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When deleting the `feature-a` branch `git` requires the `-D` flag to force the
deletion. `git` does not *work out* that `E` is *equal* to `B`, `C` and `D`
combined, so thinks that history could be lost.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git branch -D feature-a

::

    Deleted branch feature-a (was 262057a)

This leaves a tree like::

    A--E   <-master
     \
      B--C--D

B, C and D are now hanging commits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check reflog.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git reflog

This is a part of it::

    ...
    262057a HEAD@{12}: commit: D: Remove first line
    9efbf73 HEAD@{13}: commit: C: Add a third line
    f2503d5 HEAD@{14}: commit: B: Add a second line
    ...

The development commits from the *feature* development are still available and
could be checked out into *detached HEAD* state and inspected, played with,
rebranched. Let's try that.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout 262057a

Now play and explore as much as you want.

When you're ready, move back to `master`.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout master

And `git` warns us that we've left behind our hanging commits::

    Warning: you are leaving 3 commits behind, not connected to
    any of your branches:

      262057a D: Remove first line
      9efbf73 C: Add a third line
      f2503d5 B: Add a second line

    If you want to keep them by creating a new branch, this may be a good time
    to do so with:

     git branch new_branch_name 262057a


How long are hanging commits kept?
----------------------------------

But how long will these unreachable commits *hang* around for?

**We can decide!**

Hanging commits are removed from the local repository by garbage collection,
known as `gc`, or by manual removal.

There are various settings which `gc` will use to determine which commits
should be cleaned before the repository is repacked.

`gc.reflogExpireUnreachable` tells `gc` how long hanging commits should be left
in the repository. Default value is 30 days. Adjust this to a value that you
feel comfortable with. You can make that setting on any of the normal levels -
global, system or local.

Hey - you want to keep all history in the reflog for ever? Here's a setting::

    [gc]
        reflogExpire = never
        reflogExpireUnreachable = never

I'm happy with the 30 day default myself!

For more detailed explanation, checkout the Configuration section of the
`git-gc` man page.


A manual clean
--------------

Just for experimention, I tried to clean the repository of the `B`, `C` and `D`
hanging commits. This was challenging because my default settings prevented
reflog and `gc` from performing the clean, however I found `this SO answer
helpful <https://stackoverflow.com/a/14995269/1286705>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git reflog expire --all --expire-unreachable=0
    $ git repack -A -d

Repacking occurred. Now check reflog.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git reflog

::

    d0445b2 HEAD@{0}: merge feature-a-candidate: Fast-forward
    8e48d1d HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from feature-a-candidate to master
    d0445b2 HEAD@{2}: rebase -i (finish): returning to refs/heads/feature-a-candidat
    d0445b2 HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from master to feature-a
    8e48d1d HEAD@{4}: commit (initial): Make readme

There are now only two commits in the repository:

* `8e48d1d` - Initial commit `A` @ 1 and 4.
* `d0445b2` - Feature commit `E` made by the rebase @ 0, 2 and 3

The cleaned repository now looks like::

    A--E   <-master

So fresh and so clean!


Summary
-------

At the end of the day, the dev team (even if that's just you on a weekend
project) decides how best to keep history and share features.

My general solution is for:

* Squashed single-commit features.
* Detailed commit messages created at *squash-time*.
* Devs keep more history locally, either with branches or in a long-life
  reflog.
* Devs backup their repositories and don't rely on `origin`.

Remember there can be a full 30 day history (or longer depending on the
`gc.reflogExpireUnreachable` setting) in the local repo which hasn't been
pushed to `origin`. It's this history that could save your bacon one day - so
consider backing it up!

Happy source code management!

Update 23/08/2018
-----------------

See also `this comment on GitHub
<https://github.com/jamescooke/blog/issues/17>`_ from Curt J. Sampson with some
great points about when not to squash. One helpful excerpt:

    I think of a set of commits I'm proposing for master branch as a story I'm
    telling to the other developers. Make the story as clear as possible,
    divided up into reasonably small chunks where you can do so. This will make
    other developers love, rather than hate, reviewing your code.

Thanks Curt - spread the love!
