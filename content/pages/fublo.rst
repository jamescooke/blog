Hi. You're looking at this page because you've followed a link to a page on
``fublo.net`` - this was previously the website of `Fublo Ltd
<https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07469469>`_, a small digital agency
in London that closed in August 2012.


Previous work
-------------

My name is James, and I was previously an owner and a director of Fublo.

`Mark <https://www.theluckystrike.co.uk/>`_, `Oliver <https://oli.me.uk/>`_ and I
did great work for clients like Fallon London, Time Out and We Are Social.


Current work

Currently I'm working as a `Python contractor

Thanks for stopping by.
