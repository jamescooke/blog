Previous work
-------------

My name is James, and I was previously an owner and a director of Fublo.

"Soon" I'll write up the work that `Mark <https://twitter.com/markjenkins>`_,
`Oliver <https://twitter.com/OliverCaldwell>`_ and I did for clients like
Fallon London, Time Out and We Are Social.

Now we're each persuing different careers working on various sites, but still
all based in London.
