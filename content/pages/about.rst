Hello, my name is James
=======================

Thanks for visiting my site - the content here is primarily technical.

Tech
----

Python is my programming language of choice. I've worked with other programming
languages, but Python has been my favourite for about the last five years.

I love Linux. I've used other operating systems, but for the last 20 years I've
been using one or another Linux distribution at home and work.

At work, I usually focus on server-side development, so day to day I'm
predominantly developing code that creates, validates and manages data, usually
serving it to a web or mobile app.

For more information you can download a `PDF version of my CV
