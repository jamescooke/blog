Hello, my name is James
=======================

Thanks for visiting my site - the content here is primarily technical.

Tech
----

Python is my programming language of choice. I've worked with other programming
languages, but Python has been my favourite for about the last 10 years.

I love Linux. I've used other operating systems, but for the last 20 years or
so I've been using one or another Linux distribution at home and work.

Work
----

For the majority of my career, I've worked as a software engineer. I've dabbled
with various tech management roles, teaching and design, but programming is my
calling.
