About
-----

I'm a London-based web development contractor, working mainly with Linux,
Python, vim, whiteboards and hopefully as many excellent people as possible.

During my time with web, I've worked in a number of different roles focused on
development - from the specification and design, to implementation, management
and test. A full breakdown is on my `Stack Overflow CV
<http://stackoverflow.com/cv/jamescooke>`_.

Contact
-------

You can contact me about any potential projects, posts on the blog or code I've
written on Github by emailing me on `hi AT jamescooke DOT info`.

    **Note:** No agency emails please. In the last 2 years of working as a
    contractor agencies have provided 0 days of work.
