:summary: My Mako question got no views and no answers - should we be using Mako if things are so quiet?

Last week I posted a question on Stack Overflow - "`Mako template filter
ordering
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14215591/mako-template-filter-ordering>`_"
- this week it earned the `Tumbleweed badge
<http://stackoverflow.com/badges/63/tumbleweed>`_.

It's always a little concerning when libraries and toolkits you're using in a
project have forums and message boards that are a little too quiet - is there a
bad smell? Is there something bad I don't know about this tech? Even worse is
when you look around those quiet forums (or tags in Stack Overflow) you find
comments like this about the library you're being asked to use:

    :alt: Screenshot of comment on StackOverflow. Comment reads: "Suggestion:
          Don't use Mako. It's horrible. [...]"

You should listen to a `Stack Overflow moderator who has 93K points
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10870379/is-there-an-equivalent-to-django-template-filters-in-mako>`_
at time of writing right?

Meanwhile... I haven't found the reason for the template filter ordering being
strange - and I still think that the ``h`` filter is putting itself last in the
mako render order, but now I've got a work around, I'm going back to post it.

Maybe 10 more people will see it before Easter - it might even help someone.
