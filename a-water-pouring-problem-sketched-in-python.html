<h2>The&nbsp;problem</h2>
<p>At the end of last year, I came across the following water pouring problem
because something similar had come up in a friend&#8217;s functional programming&nbsp;interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>There are three glasses on the table - 3, 5, and 8 oz. The first two are
empty, the last contains 8 oz of water. By pouring water from one glass to
another make at least one of them contain exactly 4 oz of water.</strong></blockquote>

</div>
<div class="section" id="a-solution-using-search-not-algebra">
<h2>A solution using search, not&nbsp;algebra</h2>
<p>At first I started to explore the problem by looking at it algebraically. What
are the differences between each cup? How can those differences be summed
together to give the required remainder of&nbsp;4?</p>
<p>However this didn&#8217;t yield anything helpful. Instead, I started looking at the
solution states. What do the cups have to look like for the puzzle to be&nbsp;solved?</p>
<div class="section" id="two-success-states">
<h3>Two success&nbsp;states</h3>
<p>There are at least two success states. One where the 5 oz cup contains 4 oz
of water and the other where the 8 oz cup contains 4 oz of water. The other two
cups must contain the remaining 4 oz of water. This is the notation I&#8217;ve used
for these two states, where <tt class="docutils literal">x + y = 4</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[&lt;Cup x/3&gt;, &lt;Cup 4/5&gt;, &lt;Cup y/8&gt;]
</pre>
<p>And:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[&lt;Cup x/3&gt;, &lt;Cup y/5&gt;, &lt;Cup 4/8&gt;]
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-search-problem">
<h3>The search&nbsp;problem</h3>
<p>So taking the second state, and assuming that the first cup is full, then the
question&nbsp;becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
How do we get from the start state to the end state?</blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
[&lt;Cup 0/3&gt;, &lt;Cup 0/5&gt;, &lt;Cup 8/8&gt;]
...
TODO: Search in here for a path
...
[&lt;Cup 3/3&gt;, &lt;Cup 1/5&gt;, &lt;Cup 4/8&gt;]
</pre>
<p>This is really helpful. It turns an algebra problem into a search problem.
Computers are good at doing search. We can write code for&nbsp;this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-python-3-sketch">
<h2>A Python 3&nbsp;sketch</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve written some Python to solve this problems using a type of depth first
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">Tree Traversal</a> and tree
generation&nbsp;strategy.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jamescooke/water-pouring-python">code repository is available on GitHub</a>. The <span class="caps">README</span> contains the
installation and operating&nbsp;instructions.</p>
<p>These are some of the features of the&nbsp;code:</p>
<div class="section" id="cup-and-game-classes">
<h3>Cup and Game&nbsp;classes</h3>
<p>In this code, the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jamescooke/water-pouring-python/blob/master/water/cup.py">Cup
class</a>
represents a cup in the problem. Each Cup has a certain <tt class="docutils literal">capacity</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">contents</tt>. The benefit of using a Cup class as a data type is that it can
perform checks that is not holding more than its capacity of water or that it&#8217;s
holding a negative capacity of water&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jamescooke/water-pouring-python/blob/master/water/game.py">Game
class</a>
is more complex as it represents a single state in the tree. Each Game state
has three main&nbsp;properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">cups</tt> - The three Cups that make up this Game&nbsp;state.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">parent</tt> - The Game that came before this one in the search. The starting
state will have this as <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>, but all the rest will have a&nbsp;parent.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">children</tt> - Each Game will have some or no child Game states stored in a
list. These are the valid states that can be made by pouring some or all of
one Cup&#8217;s contents into another Cup in the Game that haven&#8217;t already been
seen during the&nbsp;search.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Game&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal">children</tt> property makes the Game class a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type">recursive data
structure</a> because it can
contain other instances of Games. This opens the door to the recursive search
described&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>Again using this Game type is really helpful because I&#8217;ve been able to write
tested functions for supporting data type functions like <tt class="docutils literal">__eq__</tt> (which
tests if two Game stats are logically the same). The most important function in
Game is <tt class="docutils literal">is_solvable</tt> which implements the search&nbsp;function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="recursive-search">
<h3>Recursive&nbsp;search</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the <tt class="docutils literal">Game.is_solvable</tt> function implements the tree
search, so here it is in full, comments&nbsp;removed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_solvable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_goal</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">print_trace</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">True</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">make_children</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">False</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">solvable_child</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There are two base cases to this <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)#Recursive_functions_and_algorithms">recursive function</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">self.is_goal()</tt> : Goal has been reached. This Game contains a Cup that
has 4 oz of water, success, a goal state has been found! Return <tt class="docutils literal">True</tt>
and print a trace of how the algorithm got&nbsp;here.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">self.make_children() == 0</tt> : There are no child states. This Game can not
generate any new states that don&#8217;t exist in the tree already, so this state
is a fail, return <tt class="docutils literal">False</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When neither of those two base cases are found, then this state is on a
&#8220;success path&#8221; if one of its children &#8220;is solvable&#8221;. The recursive case is that
the <tt class="docutils literal">Game.solvable_child</tt> helper function is then used to call
<tt class="docutils literal">Game.is_solvable</tt> on each of the child&nbsp;Games.</p>
<p>Here is the helper function without&nbsp;comments:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">solvable_child</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">child</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">children</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">child</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_solvable</span><span class="p">():</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">True</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">False</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There are two &#8220;interesting&#8221; features of this&nbsp;function:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It operates like a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation">short circuited <span class="caps">OR</span></a> reduction. This
means that as soon as a solvable child is found, it stops searching and
returns <tt class="docutils literal">True</tt>.</li>
<li>It has been split out from <tt class="docutils literal">Game.is_solvable</tt> to assist with unit&nbsp;testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This short circuiting feature is important. I wasn&#8217;t able to get it to work in
a <tt class="docutils literal">reduce</tt> statement on the <tt class="docutils literal">Game.children</tt>, so instead I wrote it out
explicitly as a&nbsp;for-loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="duplicate-search">
<h3>Duplicate&nbsp;search</h3>
<p>When generating new Games by pouring water from Cup to Cup, only new Game
states are added as children of any particular Game. This prevents duplication
of Games and ensures that the search will terminate once all different possible
states have been generated at the very&nbsp;latest.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Game.has_game</tt> function implements this duplicate search using a
recursive depth first tree&nbsp;search.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="as-much-functional-style-as-possible">
<h3>As much functional style as&nbsp;possible</h3>
<p>Originally I intended to write this sketch with as much <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional style code</a> as possible. However,
there were certainly some functions that we not possible to achieve this
without some serious hacking, and so I chose to keep those functions as simple
and testable as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to have the time to come back and construct a similar sketch for this
problem in&nbsp;Haskell.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="possible-improvements-and-follow-up-ideas">
<h2>Possible improvements and follow up&nbsp;ideas</h2>
<p>Apart from a fully functional rewrite, there are a couple of ways that I could
see to improve the sketch. Even though it doesn&#8217;t run slowly, there are
certainly some optimisations that could be made, plus some follow up&nbsp;ideas.</p>
<div class="section" id="save-time-by-checking-cups-contents-when-pouring">
<h3>Save time by checking Cups contents when&nbsp;pouring</h3>
<p>When generating child Game states by pouring from one cup to another, the
system does not care if a Cup has water to give or if the recipient is full. It
does the pour and then eliminates the new state because it&#8217;s a duplicate of its&nbsp;parent.</p>
<p>Instead, time could be saved by improving the pouring function so that pours
only generate new Game states when there is water to give and the destination
cup has space for that&nbsp;water.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improve-the-network-anti-duplication-search">
<h3>Improve the network anti-duplication&nbsp;search</h3>
<p>Searching the existing Game states to ensure that the same state hasn&#8217;t already
been created first runs to the top of the Game tree, then searches&nbsp;downwards.</p>
<p>Most Game states will be duplicates of a Game that&#8217;s either their parent or one
Game state away from them. This means there&#8217;s an advantage, especially when
running bigger problem searches, to search nearest Games&nbsp;first.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-a-goal-variable">
<h3>Create a <tt class="docutils literal">goal</tt> variable</h3>
<p>The code could be improved to accept a <tt class="docutils literal">goal</tt> value for the amount of water
that should be in a Cup for success to be&nbsp;achieved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="search-for-bigger-solvable-problems">
<h3>Search for bigger solvable&nbsp;problems</h3>
<p>Going meta, it would be interesting now to use this code to search for a nice
big complicated water pouring problem. What&#8217;s the largest number of Cups and
steps to success that can be&nbsp;found?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="related-stuff">
<h2>Related&nbsp;stuff</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by the power of graph searching as a replacement
for intelligence. In this example, the code has searched all possible Game
states for one that meets the success&nbsp;criteria.</p>
<p>My first introduction to this idea was via <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jul/10/uk.obituaries1">Donald Michie</a>&#8216;s  <span class="caps">MENACE</span>
machine. This was a noughts-and-crosses playing machine made from matchboxes.
It used a very simple algorithm, which is effectively a weighted graph, to
&#8220;learn&#8221; to play the game. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/ai/menace">Uppsala University has an interesting project
outline for building a code version</a>.</p>
